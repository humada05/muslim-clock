twitter suggestions

**Fajr/AM times are not working**
> Looks good. Could you add a range within which the times are valid e.g. Midnight for Isha, sunrise for Fajr..

> Is there a reason Fajr is missing? Also consider Duhaa since no other prayer is offered at that time?

**Some requests to change the formatting to make the time more clear and deliniate the prayer times more clearly.**
> Would it be too messy to make the hourly lines more prominent? Or have tiny numbers so it's easier to read the time AND read the Salah window at a glance?

**Requests to make this for the iphone/apple watch**
> i’m sure many people would use this as their default apple watch face (esp if u can show الفجر during the AM)

> Watch face and then as a standby display 👀

> The background could be a globe like the Astronomy watch face which shows a general time of day (day/night). The sides could remain the same with Fajr sharing with Asar but with different coloured markers. The dark globe during Fajr time will correspond to the Fajr limits.
