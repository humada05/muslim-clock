twitter suggestions

**Fajr/AM times are not working**

- [x] _"Looks good. Could you add a range within which the times are valid e.g. Midnight for Isha, sunrise for Fajr.."_

- [x] _"Is there a reason Fajr is missing?
- [ ] Also consider Duhaa since no other prayer is offered at that time?"_

**Some requests to change the formatting to make the time more clear and deliniate the prayer times more clearly.**
- [x] _"Would it be too messy to make the hourly lines more prominent? Or have tiny numbers so it's easier to read the time
- [ ] read the Salah window at a glance?"_

**Requests to make this for the iphone/apple watch**
- [ ] _"i‚Äôm sure many people would use this as their default apple watch face (esp if u can show ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ¨ÿ± during the AM)"_

- [ ] _"Watch face and then as a standby display üëÄ"_

- [ ] _"The background could be a globe like the Astronomy watch face which shows a general time of day (day/night). The sides could remain the same with Fajr sharing with Asar but with different coloured markers. The dark globe during Fajr time will correspond to the Fajr limits."_
